GF Timer V1.0'.
Gambling Frenzy Timer is a straight-forward on top, countdown timer and alarm for UK online casino and bingo gamblers. The UK Gambling Commisson insist that casinos constantly harrass players by messages, warnings and even bans, if they gamble for more than an hour at a time.  Run this app when you first log in to a casino and it will remind you after 57 mins to log out and take a break to avoid the hourly pop ups andhopefully avoid you getting flagged as a "problem gambl".
