GF Timer V1.5
                           Gambling Frenzy Timer is a straight-forward
                           stay on screen top, countdown timer and alarm for UK
                           online casino gamblers.
                           
                           The UK Gambling Commisson insist that casinos
                           constantly harrass players by messages, and
                           even bans, if they gamble for more than an
                           an hour at a time.
                           
                           Run this app when you first log in to a casino, click "Start Timer"
                           and GFT will remind you after 57 mins 
                           (or choose your own time limit from the info
                           menu at any time) to take
                           a break and avoid the hourly pop ups from the
                           casino.
                           
                           Doing this may help you to avoid getting flagged as a
                           problem gambler, though most casinos interpret
                           the rules differently, some are less strict than others and some
                           are just damn right facist about it.
                           
                           Tested on Windowes 7, but should work cross-platform though.
