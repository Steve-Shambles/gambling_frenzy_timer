GF Timer V1.5
                           Gambling Frenzy Timer is a straight-forward
                           stay on top, countdown timer and alarm for UK
                           online casino and bingo gamblers.
                           The UK Gambling Commisson insist that casinos
                           constantly harrass players by messages, and
                           even bans, if they gamble for more than an
                           an hour at a time,
                           Run this app when you first log in to a casino
                           Move the tiny timer window out of the way,
                           like top right
                           of your screen, and it will remind you after
                           57 mins (or choose your own time limit from the info
                           'menu) to take
                           a break and avoid the hourly pop ups from the
                           casino. Doing this may help you avoid
                           getting flagged as a
                           problem gambler, though most casinos interpret
                           the rules differently.
