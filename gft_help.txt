GF Timer V1.63

I wrote this little app for my own use so it is set up how I want it, I hope it suits your needs too, if not let me know.

Gambling Frenzy Timer is a straight-forward, stay-on-top screen, countdown timer and alarm for UK online casino and bingo gamblers.

The UK Gambling Commisson insist that casinos constantly harrass players by messages, and even bans, if they gamble for more than an an hour at a time,

Run this app when you first log in to a casino and you will reminded to take a break after 57 mins by a pop up message and alarm sound(or you can choose your own time limit from the info menu)and you will then avoid the hourly pop up reminders from the casino.

Doing this may help you to avoid getting flagged as a problem gambler, though most casinos interpret the rules differently and have their own ways of spotting addicts.
